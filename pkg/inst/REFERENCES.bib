    abstract = { This paper develops a theoretical model of location
                  choice under imperfect competition to formalize the
                  notion that firms prefer to locate “where the
                  markets are.” The profitability of a location
                  depends on a term that weights demand in all
                  locations by accessibility. Using a sample of
                  Japanese firms' choices of regions within European
                  countries, we compare the theoretically derived
                  measure of market potential with the standard form
                  used by geographers. Our results show that market
                  potential matters for location choice but cannot
                  account entirely for the tendency of firms in the
                  same industry to agglomerate. }

                  to model consumer choices from among a discrete set

                  the difficulty of constructing welfare estimates in

                  usually asked to select their most preferred option
                  from a set. Preferences can be estimated more
                  efficiently if respondents are asked to rank all
                  alternatives. When some respondents are unable to
                  perform the ranking task, using the complete ranking
                  may lead to a substantial bias. We introduce a model
                  which endogenously describes the ranking
                  capabilities of individuals. Estimated preferences
                  based on this model are more efficient when at least
                  some individuals are able to rank more than one
                  item, and they do not suffer from biases due to
                  ranking inabilities of respondents. Copyright 2010

                  methods, focusing on the many advances that are made
                  possible by simulation. Researchers use these
                  statistical methods to examine the choices that
                  consumers, households, firms, and other agents
                  make. Each of the major models is covered: logit,
                  generalized extreme value, or GEV (including nested
                  and cross-nested logits), probit, and mixed logit,
                  plus a variety of specifications that build on these
                  basics. Recent advances in Bayesian procedures are
                  explored, including the use of the
                  Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and its variant Gibbs
                  sampling. This second edition adds chapters on
                  endogeneity and expectation-maximization (EM)
                  algorithms. No other book incorporates all these
                  fields, which have arisen in the past 25 years. The
                  procedures are applicable in many fields, including
                  energy, transportation, environmental studies,

                  the ridership share on a proposed new (or improved)
                  intercity travel service and to identify the modes
                  from which existing intercity travelers will be
                  diverted to the new or upgraded service constitutes
                  a critical part of evaluating alternative travel
                  service proposals to alleviate intercity travel
                  congestion. This paper develops a new
                  heteroscedastic extreme value model of intercity
                  mode choice that overcomes the ‘independence of
                  irrelevant alternatives’ (IIA) property of the
                  commonly used multinomial logit model. The proposed
                  model allows a more flexible cross-elasticity
                  structure among alternatives than the nested logit
                  model. It is also simple, intuitive and much less of
                  a computational burden than the multinomial probit
                  model. The paper discusses the non-IIA property of
                  the heteroscedastic extreme value model and presents
                  an efficient and accurate Gaussian quadrature
                  technique to estimate the heteroscedastic model
                  using the maximum likelihood method. The multinomial
                  logit, alternative nested logit structures, and the
                  heteroscedastic model are estimated to examine the
                  impact of improved rail service on business travel
                  in the Toronto-Montreal corridor. The nested logit
                  structures are either inconsistent with utility
                  maximization principles or are not significantly
                  better than the multinomial logit model. The
                  heteroscedastic extreme value model, however, is
                  found to be superior to the multinomial logit
                  model. The heteroscedastic model predicts smaller
                  increases in rail shares and smaller decreases in
                  non-rail shares than the multinomial logit in
                  response to rail-service improvements. It also
                  suggests a larger percentage decrease in air share
                  and a smaller percentage decrease in auto share than
                  the multinomial logit. Thus, the multinomial logit
                  model is likely to provide overly optimistic
                  projections of rail ridership and revenue, and of
                  alleviation in inter-city travel congestion in
                  general, and highway traffic congestion in
                  particular. These findings point to the limitations
                  of the multinomial logit and nested logit models in
                  studying intercity mode choice behavior and to the
                  usefulness of the heteroscedastic model proposed in
                  this paper."

                  which some pairs or sets of alternatives share the
                  same unobserved attributes. The nested logit (NL)
                  model relaxes the zero covariance restriction of the
                  MNL model but imposes the restriction of equal
                  covariance among all alternatives in a common nest
                  and zero covariance otherwise. The paired
                  combinatorial logit (PCL) model relaxes these

abstract = {Abstract In economic research, it is often important to
                  express the marginal value of a variable in monetary
                  terms. In random coefficient models, this marginal
                  monetary value is the ratio of two random
                  coefficients and is thus random itself. In this
                  paper, we study the distribution of this ratio and
                  particularly the consequences of different
                  distributional assumptions about the
                  coefficients. It is shown that important
                  characteristics of the distribution of the marginal
                  monetary value may be sensitive to the
                  distributional assumptions about the random
                  coefficients. The median, however, is much less
                  sensitive than the mean. Copyright 2006 John Wiley
